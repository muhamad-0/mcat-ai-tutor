AI Engineer Exercise – MCAT AI Tutor Prototype
Overview
We are building an AI tutoring system that generates MCAT-style practice questions and explanations.
The goal is to create explanations that behave like a good tutor , not a textbook. Students should be able to
ask for:
● simpler explanations
● tighter explanations
● another way to think about the concept
● another analogy
For this exercise, you will build a small Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) prototype using MCAT
Fluid Dynamics chapters.
The exercise is intended to take about 2 hours.
A simple prototype is completely fine.

Provided Data
You will receive two PDF chapters:
● Princeton Review – Fluid Dynamics
● ExamKrackers – Fluids
These should be used as the knowledge base for your system.
Your system should retrieve relevant information from these documents to generate explanations and
questions.

Explanation Style
Explanations should sound like a tutor thinking out loud , not a textbook summary.
The structure should roughly follow this pattern:

List the small toolkit (3–5 equations or concepts needed)
Think through the logic step-by-step
Use a simple analogy
Explain the common MCAT trap
End with a simple memory rule
Example style:
Toolkit
Ohm’s Law
V = iR
Power equations
P = iV
P = i²R
Now think it through.
Imagine a battery pushing electricity through tissue.
Two things control what happens:
● how hard the battery pushes
● how hard the circuit fights back
The push = voltage.
The fight = resistance.
The thing that actually delivers energy is current.
More current → more power.
From Ohm’s law:
i = V / R
So:
● higher voltage → more current
● higher resistance → less current
Analogy
Resistance is like a clog in a pipe.
More clog → less flow.
MCAT Trap
Students see:
P = i²R
and think increasing resistance increases power.
But increasing resistance reduces current.
Memory Rule
To increase power:
● increase voltage
● decrease resistance.

Task 1 – Explanation Engine
Build a simple system that can answer questions like:
Explain Bernoulli’s principle.
Explain Bernoulli’s principle in simpler terms.
Explain Bernoulli’s principle another way.
Give another analogy for Bernoulli’s principle.
Explain why fluid moves faster in a narrow pipe.
Explain why objects float.
The system should retrieve information from the PDFs and generate explanations in the style described above.

Task 2 – MCAT Question Generator
Your system should also generate MCAT-style questions.
Example prompt:
Generate an MCAT question about buoyancy.
Expected output format:
Question
Multiple choice answers (A/B/C/D)
Correct answer
Explanation in the tutor style described above.

System Requirements
Build a simple RAG pipeline that:

Ingests the PDFs
Splits them into retrievable chunks
Creates embeddings
Retrieves relevant chunks for a question
Uses those chunks to generate explanations or questions
The system must handle mathematical formatting correctly (using LaTeX or clear plain-text notation) so
that equations don't break during the RAG retrieval process
You may use any tools such as:
Python
LangChain
LlamaIndex
OpenAI API
local embeddings
A simple implementation is sufficient.
Submission
Please submit:
● your code (GitHub repo or zip file)
● instructions to run the prototype
● a short design note (1–2 pages) explaining:
How you chunked the documents
How retrieval works
How explanation style is controlled
What you would improve with more time

Evaluation Criteria
We will evaluate:
● retrieval quality
● explanation clarity
● system design
● prompt structure
● reasoning about improvements
A working prototype with clear design decisions is more important than a polished interface.
